# Night-Terror-Plasma-GTK-Colorsheme
Night-Terror is a smooth as silk dark Plasma theme,color scheme and a GTK theme to match.


This theme orginated from my Materia-Manjaro theme but it eventually became a entire differnt theme all together.
I spent a good deal of time on just the colors getting them just right because with a theme this dark it makes 
all the difference in the world. The theme is based on Breeze.

1. Set your look and feel to normal breeze
2. Set your window decorations to breeze with gradients on and preferably disable draw circle around close button.
3. Install Night-Terror color-scheme into ~/.local/share/color-schemes
4. Install Night-Teror Plasma theme into the ~/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme
5. Install Night-Terror-GTK into either ~/.local/share/themes or I usual just install my in /usr/share/themes
6. Go into settings and set all your themes now that they are installed and don't forget to set the gtk themes to use Night-Terror
